### Description

Pulsely is a free program that allows you to very accurately and professionally measure the frequency response of audio systems, compare them and export

Currently, there are 2 types of frequency response measurements:
- Using frequency sweep (maximum accuracy, but annoying sound)
- Using white noise (does not provide high accuracy, but allows you to quickly measure the frequency response without annoying sounds)
